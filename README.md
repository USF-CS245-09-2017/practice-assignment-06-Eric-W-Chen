# CS 245 (Spring 2019) Practice Assignment 06

Used the algorithms learned in class but did not receive full points when running the test. Had to look up algorithms online and utilize the CS tutoring center to finally successfully run the test. 
Figuring out the problems with the program definitely helped my understanding of stacks and queues much more than if just copy and pasting the algorithms learned in class worked the first time, so I'm actually glad that I had to spend a little more time on the program.
